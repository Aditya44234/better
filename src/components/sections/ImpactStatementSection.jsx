          Homeownership is a huge part of our economy. Housing overall is a $33
          trillion business, and mortgages account for $15 trillion. Yet home
          finance operates in the same way it has for decades â€” through opaque
          systems and expensive intermediaries whose interests are misaligned with
          consumers.
          <br /><br />
          That's why Better.com is redefining the homeownership process from the
          ground up. We're using technology to make it faster and more efficient,
          and humans to help make it friendly and enjoyable.
